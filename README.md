Hi, this is a mini-project of basic HTML and CSS.

The purpose of this project is to practice and learn the very basics of HTML, CSS and get used to proper commit practices.
You won't find anything truly exceptional or unique, but these are some of my first steps into the full-stack developer field.
Feel free to look around!

I know the commit history will speak for itself, but wanted to add the step by step, mostly to fill a little bit the readme:

1) Create the basic files index.html and stlye.css.

2) Create the basic structure of the index.html file

3) Add the required information to be displayed on the webpage (might change it later, for now, it's enough)

4) Add the basic Syle.css structure and link it to index.htmls

5)fill the basic information that goes into each section

6) style each section one by one

7) polishing the html and css code so its more readable and efficient
